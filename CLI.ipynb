    "These are your standard streams. The reason I started with a section on files was so I could get to these babies. They are `IO` objects that every script starts with open, and they automatically close at the end. They aren't \"real\" files, but they give the same interfaces as files (besides `seek`). `stdin` is open for reading and both `stdout` and `stderr` are open for writing.\n",

    "However, the creators of Julia know that this is such a common case that both `readlines` and `eachline` default to using stdin. `eachline()` is identical to `eachline(stdin)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`stdout` is the easy one. You already know how to write to it: the `print` and `println` functions. You can also use `write`, of course, if you need to write binary data.\n",

Anyway, the library they vendor can be found [here](https://github.com/wildart/TOML.jl). There are a couple other TOML libraries on juliaobserver.com. There are also a semi-official looking packages under the JuliaIO org on github called [ConfigParser.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/ConfParser.jl) That can deal with ini files a few other types. There is also a [JSON.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl). I'm pretty against using JSON for config files, but there it is."
